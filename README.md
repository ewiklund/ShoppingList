The shopping list has different features. First, the "enter your shopping" is an input tag and requires data to 
be entered followed by an Enter. This will then show up as an li element in your browser.

The rest of the actions will show up in the console.log so you would need to open the Developer Console to see 
them. From Google Chrome, click on the 3 dots on the far top right hand side of the page, select 'More Tools' -> 'Developer Tools'.

When you select the checkbox next to "Please choose between the following options", it will show up as 
"agreeToTerms: true" in the Developer Console. 
As you fill in the credit card field, they will show up as you type. It accepts both numbers and strings. When you select a veggie from the dropdown, 
it will be added to the Developer Console as 'selectedVeggie: 'asparagus'. So the complete output may be: 

{creditCard: '49232jfdlisajhfdlsaijf', selectedVeggie: 'asparagus', agreeToTerms: true}
